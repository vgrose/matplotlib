Boot Camp Homework 5

OBSERVATIONS:

1. The drugs Infubinol and Ketapril worked no better than the placebo at reducing tumor volumes in mice, while Capomulin significantly decreased tumor volume.

2. Capomulin best prevented metastatic spread in cancerous mice. Infubinal also significantly slowed metastatic spread, while Ketapril worked about as well as the placebo.

3.Mice that were treated with Capomulin were 50% more likely to survive the experiment than mice treated with no drugs (placebo).

NOTES:
I originally wrote my code to plot all ten drugs, if anything I did is a little odd.
